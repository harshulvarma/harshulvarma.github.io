### Overview

During season 10 of Fortnite (the biggest video-game during the time), Epic Games released some controversial mid season updates including the addition of a mechanical robot 'BRUTE'.
I wanted to capture the sentiment of the player base through Twitter and visualise them for Epic Games to realise the impact of these updates. We can see how each update changes the mean sentiment of the player base vocal on Twitter.

The tweets were scraped using twitterscraper and sentiment scores were computed using vadersentiment library in Python. The final visualisation is in a dashboard form in Tableau (link above)
