### Overview

The goal of the notebook is explore how variables in a Telecom churn dataset are related to each other, identify key drivers of churn and finally predict churn. The focus of the project was on **Data Analaysis** through **Data Visualisation** and understanding important drivers of customer churn through Feature Importance by building and interpreting **Machine Learning** model. Some of the key visualisations are shown below.

### Future Changes

- I plan to make the code more modularwith functions to create visualisations
- Add hypothesis testing for in group comparisons for churn
- Include SHAP for feature importance

### Tools Utilised

- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- XGBoost
